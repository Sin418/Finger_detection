# Finger Detection and Servo Control

## Introduction

This project is the server-end component of a full-scale application that detects fingers using OpenCV (CV2) and a trained model. It then sends a `.txt` file over SSH to a Raspberry Pi, which uses the `fingers.txt` file to control servo motors. This project is designed to recognize fingers and facilitate real-world applications like robotic hand control.

## Features

- Real-time finger detection using OpenCV.
- Hand tracking and finger counting.
- Exporting detected finger data to a text file.
- Securely transferring the text file to a Raspberry Pi using SSH.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
- OpenCV (CV2)
- [cvzone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone): A Python module for computer vision.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finger-detection-and-servo-control.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd finger-detection-and-servo-control

3. **Run the main Python script::**

   ```bash
   python finger_detection.py

This script captures the webcam feed, detects fingers, and sends the finger data to a Raspberry Pi.

Press 'q' to exit the application when done.

Customization
You can customize finger detection settings in the finger_detection.py script.
Adjust the paths and authentication information for the Raspberry Pi in the script.
Raspberry Pi Setup
Ensure your Raspberry Pi is configured correctly to receive the fingers.txt file.
